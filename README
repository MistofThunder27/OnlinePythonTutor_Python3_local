This version of the repository has been updated to python 3 and is being
changed significantly to work exclusively as a standalone program running
on a custom local python server. This is part of a personal project and
so changes made will prioritise specific use cases over general ones.

Introduction:
This program a web application running on a local server where you can
type Python scripts directly into your web browser, execute those scripts,
and single-step FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS through execution in order to view
the run-time state of all data structures.

Using this tool, teachers and students can write small Python code
snippets together and see what happens to the data structures when the
code gets executed.

======
System architecture overview:

This program is implemented as a web application, with a
JavaScript front-end making AJAX calls to a pure-Python back-end.

The back-end is a python 3 local server, while the front-end
is HTML/JavaScript (using the jQuery library). It's
responsible for the input text box, submitting the Python code (as
plaintext) to the back-end, receiving an execution trace from the
back-end, and then rendering that trace as data structure
visualizations. The front-end code resides in these files in the
front_end directory:

 tutor.html
 question.html
 edu-python.js
 edu-python-tutor.js
 edu-python-questions.js
 edu-python.css
 jquery.textarea.js

 (there are also other 3rd-party JavaScript library files)

The back-end is a local python 3 server that uses the http.server module
it executes the entire script (up to a customisable 200 executed
lines, to prevent infinite loops), and collects a full trace of all
variable values (i.e., data structures) after each line has been
executed. It then sends that full trace to the front-end in a
specially-encoded JSON format. The front-end then parses and visualizes
that trace and allows the user to single-step forwards AND backwards
through execution.

The back-end includes main.py and m_pg_logger.py files:

  main.py                       - manage the local server
  m_pg_logger.py                - the 'meat' of the back-end
